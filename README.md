# Hi, I'm Darryl Gwinnett

Iâ€™m a **Lead Automation Test Engineer** with a passion for building reliable, scalable, and maintainable test solutions.  
This GitHub profile showcases my demo platform **GigTracker** and the accompanying test repositories that demonstrate different layers of the test pyramid.

## ðŸš€ Projects

### ðŸŽ¶ GigTracker
A demo platform which has been built following the excellent [Reactivities](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-guide-to-building-an-app-with-net-core-and-react) course
- **Frontend:** React (with Material UI)  
- **Backend:** .NET Core 9 (CQRS with MediatR)
- **Purpose:** Provides a realistic application for demonstrating test automation strategies across multiple tools and frameworks.

Also includes:
- **Load tests:** API load tests using NBomber to allow benchmarks of changes to the backend. To be added as a CI gate in future.
---

### ðŸ§ª GigTracker-ApiTests-Postman
A collection of **API tests** targeting the GigTracker backend.  
- Focuses on integration-level validation  
- Demonstrates request chaining, environment configuration, and reusable test scripts  
- Useful for verifying API reliability and correctness  


## Roadmap

### ðŸ”„ GigTracker-EndToEnd-Playwright *(coming soon)*
An **end-to-end test suite** covering the full GigTracker stack.  
- Built with **Playwright**, Java and **Cucumber**  
- BDD-style test definitions for improved readability and collaboration  
- Validates user journeys from UI to backend  

---

### ðŸŽ­ GigTracker-Cypress *(coming soon)*
A **UI-only test suite** for GigTracker.  
- Uses **Cypress** to test the frontend in isolation  
- Backend API calls are mocked to focus solely on the user interface  
- Ensures frontend stability and reliability independent of backend services  

---

### ðŸ“ˆ GigTracker-K6 *(coming soon)*
A collection of **performance, load, and stress tests** for the GigTracker backend.  
- Implemented using **K6**  
- Simulates realistic traffic scenarios  
- Helps evaluate system resilience under load

---

## ðŸ§° Skills Demonstrated
