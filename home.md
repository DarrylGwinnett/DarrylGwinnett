# Hi there! I'm Darryl Gwinnett 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a **Software Development Engineer in Test (SDET)** with a strong passion for building robust, scalable, and high-quality software through effective testing strategies.

# 🎸 About GigTracker

As a demonstration system under test, I've built **GigTracker**, a React-based web application that facilitates **posting, viewing, and joining gigs**. The application stack includes:
- **React** with **Semantic UI** for a user interface.
- **.NET Core 9** backend ensuring efficient data management and business logic execution, along with:
  - **Google Maps API** for seamless event location integration.
  - **Spotify API** to enrich gig listings with artist data.

## 🛠️ Test Automation & Quality Strategy

I follow a structured **test pyramid approach** to ensure the system's reliability and performance. My test strategy includes:
- **Postman** – API integration tests to validate backend endpoints.
- **Cypress** – UI tests that mock the API, ensuring frontend stability.
- **Playwright & Reqnroll (BDD)** – End-to-end acceptance tests for comprehensive system validation.
- **K6** – Performance tests to assess system behavior under load conditions.

## 🔍 What I Bring to the Table
- Expertise in **test automation frameworks** and **CI/CD pipelines**.
- Strong experience in **quality engineering**, covering functional and non-functional testing.
- Hands-on knowledge of **DevOps** and **test-driven development (TDD)** principles.
- Passion for **continuous improvement** and **collaborative problem-solving**.
